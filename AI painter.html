<h4>AI painter can make so many great artÔºÅ</h4>
<p>the AI paiter i use to make the pictures is gaugan and wombo</p>
<p>i personally will choose wombo because it got different style and what it make is predicable.</p>
<p>but gaugan's art is more connect with what you imput, it can be also a practise of drawing</p>
<p>and after i got the AI painter's product, i make some change by using photoshop</p>
<p>the first piscture is take away some part of it</p>
<p>and the second one i add a layer and make a shadow on it, so it is more complex</p>
<p>and this is what after ps!</p>
